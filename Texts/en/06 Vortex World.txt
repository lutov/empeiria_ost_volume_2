[Intro]

[Verse]
In a world of wonder, where the vortex spins
Lies a strange construction, where the story begins
Tiers upon tiers, reaching for the sky
Each level holds mysteries, unforeseen and high

[Pre-Chorus]
On a world of marvels, in a vortex grand
Tiers rising high, like a castle built by hands
In the center, a cosmic sun, casting light divine
The higher you climb, the stranger the signs

[Chorus]
We climb the tiers of this strange land
Discovering wonders, beyond our command
As the sun rises and sets in the center's glow
The higher we climb, the stranger things will show

[Bridge]

[Verse]
In a world spun by cosmic design
Where layers swirl like a divine rhyme
A vortex of mystery, a tapestry unfurls
Each tier holds secrets, unknown worlds

[Pre-Chorus]
We climb higher, chasing the sun
But with each step, the stranger things become
As the veil ascends, reality bends
In this rising vortex, our journey never ends

[Chorus]
In this labyrinth of dreams, where reality seems to blur
Lost in the twilight, we're reaching for the stars
With each step we take, a mystery unravels
In this cosmic labyrinth, where magic and darkness travel

[Outro]
In this realm of mystery, where dreams take flight
Chase the sunrise, let go of the night
Vertigo's ascent, a journey of the soul
Unravel the secrets, let the mysteries unfold
