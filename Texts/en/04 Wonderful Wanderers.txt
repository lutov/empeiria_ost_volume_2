[Intro]

[Verse]
On a sunny day, two twins set out
Brother and sister, without a doubt
With hair as white as freshly fallen snow
They wandered far, where no one would go

(They sang "la-la-la-la-la")

[Chorus]
Through fields of green and forests untamed
The Albion Twins, they were never the same
With hearts so pure, they spread their love and light
Practicing magic, healing all in their sight

(They sang "ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh")

[Verse]
In a world full of colors, they were pale and fair
A pair of wandering twins with silver-white hair
Brother and sister, with hearts open wide
They set off on a journey, side by side

(They sang "la-la-la-la-la")

[Chorus]
Through the meadows and the forest they would roam
Leaving trails of magic everywhere they'd go
With healing in their hands, they touched the hearts they found
The wandering Albions, spreading love around

(They sang "ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh")

[Verse]
In a world of wonders, where the light dances bright
There's a pair of wanderers, glowing in the night
Brother and sister, hand in hand they roam
With their healing magic, they'll make any place feel like home

(They sang "la-la-la-la-la")
(They sang "ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh")

[Chorus]
Through the meadows and the forest they would roam
Leaving trails of magic everywhere they'd go
With healing in their hands, they touched the hearts they found
The wandering Albions, spreading love around

[Outro]
