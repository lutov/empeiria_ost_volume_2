[Intro]

[Verse]
In a city of marvels, where the streets are gold
The markets bustle with treasures untold (oh-yeah)
Taverns echo with laughter and cheers
Museums and theaters bring joy to all ears (oooh-oooh)

[Verse]
In the city's heart where the cobblestones lay (lay)
There's a place where wonders never fade away (away)
Gilded halls where merchants sell their wares (oh-oh)
Entertainers fill the squares, catchin' stares (catchin' stares)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, the wonders of this grand city
Where dreams come true and legends are born
But beware the darkness that lurks at night
For the shadows hold secrets and danger in sight (watch out)

[Chorus]
Oh, the city of wonders, where secrets lie (secrets lie)
By day, a paradise, under moonlight, beware the night (beware the night)
Naive traveler, heed this as your guide (heed this as your guide)
In the city of splendors, danger hides (danger hides)
(ooooh)

[Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, the streets of medieval dreams (dreams)
Markets bustling with grand schemes (grand schemes)
Taverns echoed with laughter and song (with laughter and song)
Museums filled with tales that belong (tales that belong)
But beware, weary traveler, heed this rhyme (oh-oh)
In the shadows, dangers lurk at night (at night)

[Chorus]
Oh, the city of wonders, where secrets lie (secrets lie)
By day, a paradise, under moonlight, beware the night (beware the night)
Naive traveler, heed this as your guide (heed this as your guide)
In the city of splendors, danger hides (danger hides)
(ooooh)
