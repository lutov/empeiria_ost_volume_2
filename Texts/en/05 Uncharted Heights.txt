[Intro]

[Verse]
Through the icy winds and treacherous snow
We climb the mountain, where no one dares go
Legends are made, in these perilous heights
Defying the odds, in fearless pursuit of the light

[Chorus]
We're the guardians of the summit (oh, we won't quit)
We'll push through the pain, never admitting defeat
Though our comrades may fall (fall), we'll continue to rise
Exploring new lands, reaching for the skies

(will breaks the ice)

[Bridge]

[Verse]
Onward we climb, through the bitter cold and storm
Our bodies weary, but our spirits untouched
With every step, we leave behind the fallen souls
Their sacrifice whispers, urging us to push on

(to the top and beyond)

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll conquer these uncharted heights (heights)
Where others falter, we will rise (we will rise)
No turning back, no fear in our eyes
For the new lands beyond, we'll pay any price (any price)

[Chorus]
We're the guardians of the summit (oh, we won't quit)
We'll push through the pain, never admitting defeat
Though our comrades may fall (fall), we'll continue to rise
Exploring new lands, reaching for the skies

(reach for the stars)

[Outro]
