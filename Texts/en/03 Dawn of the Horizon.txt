[Intro]

(oo oo oo oo)
(praise the rising sun)

[Verse]
In the darkness before the dawn, a silence fills the air
A new day starts to rise, light breaking through the despair
The world awakens, colors spread across the sky
As the sun ascends, and the creatures come alive

[Chorus]
Oh, see the rising sun, igniting the land
Untamed and wild, a beauty so grand
From mountains high to the depths down below
In a symphony of life, a new chapter unfolds

(oo oo oo oo)
(praise the rising sun)

[Verse]
As the darkness surrenders to the light
A new day breaks, a masterpiece in sight
Golden rays pierce through the misty air
Awakening the world with tender care

[Chorus]
The dawn of the horizon, a majestic view (view)
The sun rising high, painting skies with hues (hues)
Creatures emerging, to the heavens they sing (sing)
A symphony of life, greeting what the dawn brings

(oo oo oo oo)
(praise the rising sun)

[Chorus]
Oh, see the rising sun, igniting the land
Untamed and wild, a beauty so grand
From mountains high to the depths down below
In a symphony of life, a new chapter unfolds

(oo oo oo oo)
(praise the rising sun)

[Outro]
