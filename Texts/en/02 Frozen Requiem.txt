[Verse]
In the depths of the cosmos, a forgotten tale untold,
A spaceship veered off course, its destiny unforetold.
From the crashing flames, demons emerged, wicked and dark,
Stranded on a frozen landscape, their fate ripped apart.

[Pre-Chorus]
Lost in endless strife, they battle without reprieve,
In a desolate realm, where time itself starts to deceive,
Their souls intertwined in a cosmic dance of despair,
Fighting each other, in a frozen hell's icy air.

[Chorus]
Demons clash upon the barren ground,
Eternally bound in this desolate sound,
Their tortured screams echo far and wide,
In this frozen hell where they reside.

[Verse]
On a distant planet, where no warmth can be found,
These fallen creatures wage war, their hearts icy and bound,
The stars hide their gaze, as the moon bears witness to the plight,
Demons from the crashed spaceship, locked in eternal fight.

[Pre-Chorus]
In this realm of frost and snow, where hope is hard to bear,
They claw and tear at one another, with hearts so unfair,
Through the ceaseless battles, forged by the fires below,
Their souls forever trapped, in a never-ending woe.

[Chorus]
Demons clash upon the barren ground,
Eternally bound in this desolate sound,
Their tortured screams echo far and wide,
In this frozen hell where they reside.

[Bridge]
Frozen tears crystallize, upon wrathful faces,
They yearn for release from these bitter, icy spaces,
Their once human hearts, now consumed by vile rage,
Condemned to fight forever, in this cursed, frozen cage.

[Chorus]
Demons clash upon the barren ground,
Eternally bound in this desolate sound,
Their tortured screams echo far and wide,
In this frozen hell where they reside.

[Outro]
In this tapestry of torment, their existence bleak and cold,
Demons from the crashed spaceship, forever locked, behold,
Their souls intertwined in an everlasting conflict's light,
Fighting each other, in eternal darkness, never reaching the light.
