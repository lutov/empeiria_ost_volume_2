[Verse]
Yo, we're the kings of the stone built jungle
Born and bred in the depths of the struggle (struggle)
Urchins of the night, we rule the shadows
Always ready for battle, overthrowing pharaohs (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Streets on fire, we rise from the flames (oh-oh-oh)
Urchins of the underworld, we reign (we reign)
In this city's heart, we claim the crown (crown)
Never backing down, we run this town (ooh-yeah)

[Verse]
We're the kings of the ruins, the untamed streets
Living wild and free, no time for defeat
Urchins on the rise, relentless and fierce
Taking on the rivals, no mercy, no tears

(Street fighters) in the torch-lit alleyways
(Breakin' bones) in the city's darkest days
(Yeah, we're) the underground's crown jewels
(Living fearless) like outlaws, breaking the rules

[Chorus]
We're the urban warriors, fightin' for our pride
Nothin' can stop us, we won't be denied
Bare-knuckle brawlin', heart pumping strong
We're the kings of the city, where we belong

(Street warriors, we're the undercity kings)
(Fighting for power, hear our battle cries sing)

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Streets on fire, we rise from the flames (oh-oh-oh)
Urchins of the underworld, we reign (we reign)
In this city's heart, we claim the crown (crown)
Never backing down, we run this town (ooh-yeah)

(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
(Undercity warriors, we'll never back down)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
(We're the rulers of the underground town)

(Street fighters) in the torch-lit alleyways
(Breakin' bones) in the city's darkest days
(Yeah, we're) the underground's crown jewels
(Living fearless) like outlaws, breaking the rules

[Chorus]
We're the urban warriors, fightin' for our pride
Nothin' can stop us, we won't be denied
Bare-knuckle brawlin', heart pumping strong
We're the kings of the city, where we belong
