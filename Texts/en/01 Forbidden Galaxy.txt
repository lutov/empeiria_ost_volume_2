[Intro]
Through the darkness of the void we trail alone
A spacecraft of millennium, mission unknown
Onboard are strangers with stories untold
Machines of power, secrets to unfold

[Verse]
Into the great unknown we soar
In a vessel bound for distant shores
Carry the weight of forbidden might
Through the stars we journey in the dead of night

[Chorus]
In this forbidden galaxy we find
The power of the unknown, secrets unwind.
Artifacts of ancients of infinite might,
A battle for survival, the ultimate fight. (fight, fight, fight)

[Verse]
Lost in the vast expanse of space,
A mission gone awry, a treacherous chase.
Crash landing on a foreign terrain,
With dangerous prisoners, their sinister reign.

[Chorus]
Crash landing in a spiral of fire
Dangerous prisoners, their wrath we inspire
Technical miracles with power untold
We are the lost souls, the story unfolds

[Solo]

[Verse]
In the depths of space, a ship sails on the night
Carrying prisoners of darkness, locked up tight
A crash in the atmosphere, danger fills the air
The power within, unleashed beyond compare

[Chorus]
Crash landing echoes through the night
Dangerous prisoners escape, ready to ignite
Technical devices, power beyond our control
In the wreckage, chaos ensues, a battle to unfold

[Chorus]
In this forbidden galaxy we find
The power of the unknown, secrets unwind.
Artifacts of ancients of infinite might,
A battle for survival, the ultimate fight. (fight, fight, fight)

[Outro]
