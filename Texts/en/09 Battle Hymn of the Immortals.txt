[Verse]
In the depths of time, a prophecy spoken
A tournament held, of heroes unbroken
Chosen warriors, tested in combat
Fighting for the gift, the gift of immortal life

[Chorus]
Unbreakable, they march into the fight
Fearless and strong, they'll defend with all their might
In the arena, where legends are made
A hero faces a villain, in combat they'll engage

(choice is easier than ever)
(fall today or live forever)

[Bridge]

[Verse]
In the realm of eternal glory
Where legends are born, the chosen warriors
With swords of steel, hearts of fire
They march into battle, fueled by desire

[Chorus]
Unbreakable, they march into the fight
Fearless and strong, they'll defend with all their might
In the arena, where legends are made
A hero faces a villain, in combat they'll engage

(will breaks the ice)
(will breaks the steel)
(but only one forever will)
(will become immortal)

[Verse]
In the realm of ancient glory, where the legends come alive
Warriors assemble, prepare to fight
With swords of steel and hearts of fire, they march into the night
Destined to conquer, never to hide

[Chorus]
Unbreakable, they march into the fight
Fearless and strong, they'll defend with all their might
In the arena, where legends are made
A hero faces a villain, in combat they'll engage

[Outro]
